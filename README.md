iPhone-OCR-Tesseract-and-OpenCV
===============================


This is a sample project created by me (@PablosPoject) and @_AJ_R for academic purpose.
It use the OpenCV framework and tutorial made by BloodAxe(https://github.com/BloodAxe) and some other utilities class made by Aptogo (https://github.com/aptogo).
It also uses the Tesseract OCR engine to read the text processed with openCV.

I also build a simple user interface that permit to take a photo or choose one from library, and also permit to apply to the image every single step in the image processing, or to apply directly all the processing.

I hope that these can be useful for someone!
Enjoy!
